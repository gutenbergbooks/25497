<h2>THE FIVE LITTLE FRIENDS<br />
AT SCHOOL</h2>


<p>Bob and Betty, Paul and Peggy
and little Dot are five little friends.
They go to the same school. Many
other children go to the school too,
but these five little friends are the
ones this story is about.</p>

<p>Bob is the tall boy in the brown
suit. Betty is the girl in the
checked dress. Paul is the boy
with the white blouse. Peggy is
the girl with curls. Little Dot is
the tiny child with bobbed hair.</p>

<p>Bob and Betty, Paul and Peggy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and little Dot have a very fine
teacher. She is called Miss West.
Many other children are in Miss
West's room too. But the five little
friends are the ones this story is
about.</p>

<p>One morning when the children
came to school Miss West had a
surprise for them. On her desk
was something large and round. It
was all covered with paper.</p>

<p>"Guess what this is, children,"
said Miss West.</p>

<p>"It is a balloon," said Bob.</p>

<p>"I think it is a football," said
Paul.</p>

<p>"No, no, you are both wrong,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
said Miss West. She took the
paper off. What do you think it
was?</p>

<p>It was a big glass bowl. In it
were six goldfish. They were
swimming about in the water.</p>

<p>"Little folks," said Miss West,
"these are our school pets. We
must feed them and give them
fresh water. Then they will live a
long time and we can have fun
watching them."</p>

<p>The children stood around the
bowl. They watched the fish swim
and float. They laughed when one
fish chased another round and
round the bowl. He looked very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
funny with his big mouth wide
open.</p>

<p>Soon Miss West showed the children
how to feed the fish. After
that they took turns in caring for
them. Paul and Peggy had the
first turn. Next Bob and Betty
had their turn. After that little
Dot took care of the fish all by
herself. The other children had
turns too. But this story is
about the five little children
whose names you know.</p>

<p>One day Miss West said to the
children, "How many of you little
girls and boys have pets of your
own?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>A great many hands were raised.</p>

<p>"I have!" said Bob.</p>

<p>"I have!" said Paul.</p>

<p>"I have," "I have," "I have,"
said Betty and Peggy and little
Dot.</p>

<p>"I have thought of a fine plan,"
said Miss West. "Each day one
child may tell the other children
about his pet."</p>

<p>"What fun!" said Betty; and all
the other children thought, "What
fun that will be!"</p>

<p>"Who will have the first turn?"
asked Bob.</p>

<p>"We will play a game to see,"
said Miss West.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i002.jpg" width="400" height="314" alt="Peggy drew out a slip" title="Peggy drew out a slip" />
</div>

<p>So Miss West wrote the names of
all the children on slips of paper
Then she put all the slips in Paul's
cap. Next she blindfolded Peggy.
Peggy put her hand in the cap and
drew out a slip. What name do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
you think was on this slip? The
name was <i>Dot</i>.</p>

<p>So the next day little Dot told
about her pet. This is what she
said:</p>

<p>"My pet is a white cat. Her
name is Snowball. She is as white
as snow. When she curls up in
front of the fire she is round like a
ball.</p>

<p>"One day my daddy could not
find his hat. He looked and looked
and looked for it. At last he found
it in a dark corner under the stairs.</p>

<p>"There was something in the hat.
First Daddy saw two bright eyes.
Then he saw Snowball all curled up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in the hat. By her side were two
little baby kittens. They were just
like their mother. We named
them Fluff and Muff. Now we
have a happy cat family.</p>

<p>"Daddy never got his hat back.
At first the kittens slept in it. Now
Fluff and Muff are so big they
sleep in a box. But they like
Daddy's hat to play with. Fluff
gets on one side and Muff on the
other. Then they pull and pull.
Daddy's hat is almost worn out
now."</p>

<p>The children liked little Dot's
story very much. They laughed
when they thought of Fluff on one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
side and Muff on the other and
Daddy's hat in the middle.</p>

<p>The next day Betty was blindfolded.
She put her hand in the
cap and drew a slip. This time
<i>Paul</i> was written on the slip. So it
was Paul's turn to tell about his
pet. This is what he said:</p>

<p>"My pet is a big collie dog. His
name is Hero. When my mother
goes to market she takes Hero with
her. He trots by her side and
carries a basket in his mouth.</p>

<p>"Sometimes my mother sends
Hero home with the meat and
bread for dinner. He goes right
along. He does not stop or look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
around. When he comes to our
house he sets the basket down.
Then he watches it until Mother
comes. If anyone calls, 'Here,
Hero,' he pricks up his ears, but he
will not move from his place.</p>

<p>"One day I tried to coax him
away with a big bone. I know the
bone looked and smelled good to
Hero. He sniffed the air and
looked at the bone with hungry
brown eyes, but he never moved
from the basket.</p>

<p>"Last summer we went to the
seashore. We took Hero with us.
One day I was on the beach, playing
in the sand. Hero was lying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
asleep in the sun. I was making a
sand fort and my back was toward
the sea.</p>

<p>"Suddenly a big wave dashed in
and knocked me down. Then
another big wave came and carried
me out into the water. As I did
not know how to swim, I was very
much frightened. I tried to call
out, but my mouth was full of sea
water. I could make only a little
frightened sound; but Hero heard
me. What do you think he did?
He jumped into the water and
swam out to me. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>I was too nearly
drowned to catch hold of him.
So he took my clothes in his mouth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and began to swim with me to
the shore.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 288px;">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="288" height="400" alt="THE RESCUE" title="THE RESCUE" />
<span class="caption">THE RESCUE</span>
</div>

<p>"I was heavy, and Hero was
almost worn out before he got
there. But he never once let go.
He kept right on until he dropped
me on dry land. Then he lay panting
on the sand.</p>

<p>"Just then Mother came to
see where I was. When she saw
what had happened she hugged me
hard. Then she hugged Hero hard
too. The next day she bought
Hero a new collar with his name
on it in big letters&mdash;HERO. That
night Hero had a big bone with lots
of meat on it for his supper."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The children enjoyed Paul's story
as much as they had Dot's. They
thought Hero was a fine name for
such a brave dog. They said Paul
was a lucky boy to have a pet like
that.</p>

<p>On another day little Dot was
blindfolded. The slip of paper she
drew had this name on it&mdash;<i>Betty</i>.
So it was Betty's turn to tell about
her pet. This is what she told:</p>

<p>"My pet is a pigeon. He is not
just a common pigeon like the ones
on the church roof. He is a carrier
pigeon. My Uncle Fred brought
him from France. He calls him the
living airplane. Can you tell why?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is named Arrow. In France
Arrow used to carry messages to
the soldiers. These messages were
written on tiny slips of paper and
tied around Arrow's neck.</p>

<p>"When Uncle Fred came home he
taught Arrow to go from my grandmother's
house to our house and
straight back again. It was a ten
mile trip.</p>

<p>"This is the way Uncle Fred did
it. Almost every day he would
feed Arrow at both places. It was
easy for him to do this as he used
to ride over to our house a great
deal. When he took Arrow away
from one place he would leave some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
grain there. Arrow knew this. So
when he was let loose he would fly
straight to the grain. He never
seemed to lose his way or stop in
the wrong place.</p>

<p>"On Valentine's Day, Uncle Fred
wanted to surprise me. He turned
Arrow loose at Grandmother's
house with something tied around
his neck by a ribbon. Uncle Fred
did not tell anyone what it was.</p>

<p>"Arrow flew straight to our
house. When I saw him I ran out
to his feeding place. I spied the
ribbon and untied it. I found a
tiny gold heart with my name on it.
I liked this Valentine best of all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Betty and Arrow" title="Betty and Arrow" />
</div>

<p>The boys and girls in the class
enjoyed the story of Arrow. They
liked it so much that Betty said she
would ask Uncle Fred to come to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
school and tell about what Arrow
did in France.</p>

<p>Another day when one of the
pupils was blindfolded and drew a
slip of paper, the name on the slip
was <i>Bob</i>. So at last it was Bob's
turn. This is the story Bob told:</p>

<p>"My pet is a pony named
Dandy. Grandfather bought him
for me. He got him from a man
who had a pony show. This man
had taught Dandy many tricks.</p>

<p>"When I say, 'Dandy, how old
are you?' Dandy lifts his right
front foot and brings it down three
times. This is how he says that
he is three years old. When I say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
'Make a bow, Dandy,' he puts his
front feet out and bows his head
almost to the ground. His mane
hangs over his eyes and he looks
very funny.</p>

<p>"Dandy can play 'Hide-and-Go-Seek'
too. This is the way he does
it. I take an ear of corn and show
it to him. Then I run and hide it.
I call, 'Come, Dandy, come.' He
comes and looks all around for the
corn. When he finds it, he takes
it in his mouth and trots around
and around with it. When I say,
'Bring it to me, Dandy,' he comes
to me with the ear of corn in his
mouth. But when I try to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the corn, he shakes his head and
trots away again.</p>

<p>"One day I tried to play 'Hide-and-Go-Seek'
with a handkerchief
instead of an ear of corn. Dandy
did not like it this way. He
looked at the handkerchief. Then
he sniffed at it. At last he shook
his head and turned away. He
seemed to say, 'A game like that
may be fun for a boy, but it isn't
fun for a pony. I am not going to
play.'"</p>

<p>Everyone liked the story of
Dandy. Some of the children
asked to hear some more about
him. But Miss West said it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
time for recess. So the children
went out into the school yard and
played "Pony" and "Hide-and-Go-Seek."</p>

<p>Another day someone drew
Peggy's name on the slip of paper.
And this is what Peggy told:</p>

<p>"My pet is a big green and red
parrot. She has a cage in the living
room. Mother calls her 'the
General' because she likes to give
orders. When we sit down Polly
calls out, 'Get busy! Get busy!
Get busy!' If we are too busy and
do not notice Polly she rolls over
on her back in the bottom of the
cage and cries, 'Come quick!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Come quick! Polly's sick! Polly's
sick!' In the evening we put a
cloth over Polly's cage to keep her
quiet. When the cloth is taken off
in the morning she begins to shout,
'Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!'</p>

<p>"One evening we forgot to put
the cloth over Polly's cage. That
night, quite late, my big brother
went down into the living room to
find a book he had been reading.
When he turned on the light, Polly
thought it was day. She began to
scream, 'Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up!'</p>

<p>"Everyone <i>did</i> wake up. At first
we were frightened. But when we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
found out what had happened we
laughed and laughed. We laughed
more when we heard a voice croak,
'Come quick! Come quick! Polly's
sick! Polly's sick!'"</p>

<p>The girls and boys all laughed at
the story of Polly. Paul wrote a
poem about her. This is what he
wrote:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Upon my word,<br />
Poll's a funny bird.<br />
</div>

<p>The children went around at
recess saying this. They said some
of Polly's speeches too.</p>

<p>One day Miss West told the children
a true story that was very,
very sad. It was about a blind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
man who sold papers. He had
owned a little dog that used to lead
him to his work and watch him all
day; but the little dog had died.
Now the poor man had no one to
lead him. So he could not sell his
papers.</p>

<p>The children were very sorry for
him. They wanted to do something
to help.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be fine," said Betty,
"if we could buy him another dog?"</p>

<p>"But how can we get the
money?" said Paul.</p>

<p>"We could give all our pennies,
but that wouldn't be enough," said
little Dot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know, I know!" cried Bob.
"Let's give a show and have our
pets for the show animals."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 222px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="222" height="300" alt="Pet Show" title="Pet Show" />
</div>

<p>The children
thought
this was a
fine plan.
Miss West
thought so
too. She let
them plan
for the show.</p>

<p>Then she
let them make tickets. Each child
made two tickets. They were like
the funny picture in the middle of
this page.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Everyone who came had to pay
for a ticket. Even the children
who had pets in the show had to
pay.</p>

<p>When the big children heard
about the Pet Show they bought
tickets too. Then they helped the
five little friends get ready for the
show.</p>

<p>The school yard was the show
ground. The big boys made a gate
for the people to come through.
They made pens for all the animals.
Next they printed some big signs
to put on the pens. The signs
were like these only much, much
bigger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 288px;">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" width="288" height="300" alt="THE SIGNS WERE LIKE THESE ONLY MUCH, MUCH BIGGER" title="THE SIGNS WERE LIKE THESE ONLY MUCH, MUCH BIGGER" />
<span class="caption">THE SIGNS WERE LIKE THESE ONLY MUCH, MUCH BIGGER</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>At last it was the day of the Pet
Show. Bob and Betty, Paul and
Peggy and little Dot came early
with their pets. Soon the other
children came too. There were big
children, and middle-sized children,
and little wee children.</p>

<p>When they stopped at the gate
who do you think the ticket man
was? It was Hero with a basket
in his mouth. The children dropped
their tickets into the basket. They
patted Hero's shaggy head and
called him "Good dog" and "Brave
old fellow."</p>

<p>He looked very kind but very,
very solemn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 289px;">

<span class="caption">THEY DROPPED THEIR TICKETS INTO THE BASKET</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>They went to all the pens to see
the show pets. Dandy stood in his
pen. He looked very wise and very
plump and shaggy. He poked his
head out and let the children stroke
his mane.</p>

<p>In Polly's pen nothing could be
seen but a big cage with a black
cover over it. Not one bright
feather showed. Not a single sound
came from the cage.</p>

<p>Snowball and her kittens were
curled up in their box. They were
as quiet as mice. All three had
red and blue ribbons around their
necks.</p>

<p>The pen with Arrow's name on it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
was empty. On the ground some
grain was scattered. By the grain
were three light gray feathers. But
no living airplane could be seen.
"Where can he be?" the children
asked.</p>

<p>Just then Bob came out in front
of the children. He was dressed
like a real showman. He had on a
high hat and a long coat. "Ladies
and gentlemen," he said, in a funny
deep voice, "the big show is about
to begin. Will you please find seats
in the show tent?" The children
laughed and sat down on the
ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 283px;">

<span class="caption">HE WAS DRESSED LIKE A REAL SHOWMAN</span>
</div>

<p>Bob went on talking like a showman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
"Ladies and gentlemen," he
said, "you are now to see Dandy,
the trick pony." When he had said
this, Bob went to the pen and
brought Dandy out.</p>

<p>"Now Dandy," he said, "tell the
ladies and gentlemen how old you
are." Dandy lifted his right foot
and brought it down three times.
The children clapped their hands.</p>

<p>"Make a bow to the ladies and
gentlemen, Dandy," said Showman
Bob. Dandy put his front feet out.
Then he bowed his head almost to
the ground. His mane fell over his
eyes and he looked very wise and
funny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Next Bob took an ear of corn
from his pocket. He held it in
front of Dandy's nose. "Dandy, do
you see this?" he said. Dandy
nodded his head. His mane fell
over his eyes. He looked very
funny and full of mischief.</p>

<p>"Now Dandy," said Showman
Bob, "shut your eyes." Dandy
winked and blinked. Then he shut
his eyes tight. "Keep your eyes
shut till I call 'Come,'" said Bob.
Then Bob started off with the ear
of corn.</p>

<span class="caption">BOB HID THE EAR OF CORN BEHIND A BOX</span>
</div>

<p>Dandy kept his eyes shut just
one little minute. Then he opened
them and began to peep. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
peeped very slyly to see where Bob
was hiding the corn. The children
shouted with joy! Then Showman
Bob came back. The corn was
still in his hand. He pretended to
be angry. He made Dandy hide
his eyes once more.</p>

<p>Again Dandy peeped slyly to see
where Bob was hiding the corn. At
last Showman Bob took little Dot's
hat and tied it over Dandy's eyes.
How the children did laugh!
Dandy looked so funny with a little
girl's hat on.</p>

<p>Then Bob hid the ear of corn
behind a box. He called, "Come,
Dandy, come!" Dandy shook his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
head very hard. The hat rolled on
the ground. Then Dandy began
going round the show grounds. He
stopped and sniffed at everything.
"Oh see!" said Peggy, "Dandy is
looking with his nose!" Soon
Dandy sniffed at the box and found
the ear of corn.</p>

<p>"Come, Dandy, come!" called
Showman Bob. Dandy came trotting
up with the ear of corn in his
mouth. But when Bob put out his
hand for the corn Dandy kicked
up his heels and away he went.
He ran round and round like a
pony in a circus.</p>

<p>The children clapped their hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and shouted. Dandy went faster
and faster. It was very exciting.
At last Dandy stopped running.
Then Bob led him back to the pen.
There the little pony munched the
corn happily.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="300" height="298" alt="General Polly" title="General Polly" />
</div>

<p>Next it was Peggy's turn to show
Polly. Showman Bob brought out
a table. Then he helped Peggy put
Polly's big cage on it. Peggy lifted
the black cloth. There was Polly!
She was the greenest, reddest, funniest
parrot you ever saw. She
winked her eyes, shook her feathers,
and called out, "Wake up! Wake
up! Wake up!" The children
laughed; but they did not get up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
So General Polly sang out, "Get
busy! Get busy! Get busy!" The
children soon knew what they must
"get busy" about. Polly began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
say in her most coaxing voice,
"Polly wants a cracker! Poor Poll!
Pretty Poll! Poor Polly wants a
cracker!" This sounded so funny
that everybody laughed.</p>

<p>Peggy had some crackers in her
pocket. She took them out and let
the children feed Polly. They
poked bits of cracker through the
wires of her cage. Polly was not
very polite. She pecked and
grabbed and talked to herself. But
everything she did was so funny
that the children enjoyed it.</p>

<p>At last Polly had all the crackers
she wanted. Then she grew tired
and cross. She began to scream,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
"Bad boy! Go away! Go away! Go
away!" The children ran back to
their seats. General Polly was left
all alone.</p>

<p>For a time she liked this. She
swung on her perch and made
queer noises to herself. Then she
grew tired. She threw herself on
the bottom of the cage and began
to moan, "Come quick! Come
quick! Polly's sick! Polly's sick!"
Then Peggy came with the black
cloth, and General Polly was taken
to her pen.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 292px;">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" width="292" height="300" alt="Dot and her cat family" title="Dot and her cat family" />
</div>

<p>Next it was little Dot's turn to
show her cat family. She was too
shy to play showman as Bob had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
done. She just came out in front of
the children and stood there. Snowball
was in her arms and Fluff and
Muff were on her shoulders. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
put Snowball down. Then she gave
her shoulders a shake and Fluff and
Muff scrambled down to the ground.</p>

<p>Next Dot took two red balls from
her pocket. Each ball had a long
rubber fastened to it. It would
bounce high without rolling away.
Dot put a ball near each kitten's
paws. Just as Fluff and Muff
sprang to get the balls, Dot pulled
the rubber. You never saw such
surprised kittens! They sat still
and looked with wide-open eyes.
These were queer balls indeed that
flew up into the air instead of
rolling on the floor. This was
something new and strange.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The next time Dot bounced the
balls Fluff and Muff were ready.
Up they jumped, with their paws
raised, but the balls sprang out of
reach. "The kittens are trying to
be living airplanes, too," said
Paul.</p>

<p>Next Dot went to the pen and
brought something back. She held
it up and said shyly, "This is
Daddy's hat. It used to be the
kittens' bed. Now it is their plaything."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i012.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Fluff and Muff" title="Fluff and Muff" />
</div>

<p>When she had said this she threw
the hat on the ground. Quick as a
wink Fluff was on one side of it and
Muff was on the other. Then they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
began to paw and pull. Fluff pulled
one way. Muff pulled the other.
It was a real pulling match. Some
of the children cried, "I think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that Fluff will win." Others cried,
"Hurrah for Muff."</p>

<p>Just then a queer noise was
heard. Can you guess what it was?
It was the brim of Daddy's hat. It
had torn all the way around&mdash;<i>rip,
rip, rip</i>. Off it came so suddenly
that both little kittens rolled over
backward.</p>

<p>All the children clapped their
hands and laughed aloud. This
frightened Fluff and Muff. They
scampered to their mother as fast
as their little white feet could carry
them. This ended the act of the
cat family.</p>

<p>Next it was Betty's turn to show<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Arrow. But Arrow's pen was still
empty. Betty whispered to Miss
West. Miss West rose and said,
"While we are waiting for the next
act, let's sing together." She
started a song everyone knew.
All the children joined in.</p>

<p>Just as they were singing a
second song, something happened.
A light speck was seen moving
through the air. It came nearer
and nearer. At last it circled round
the pen, where the grain was scattered.
Then it flew slowly to the
ground. It was Arrow, the living
airplane.</p>

<p>The children crowded about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
pen to see. "Look," said one of
them. "There is something around
Arrow's neck!" Betty bent over and
looked. Yes, there <i>was</i> something.
She untied it quickly. On a piece
of paper was written, "This is
Arrow's gift to the blind man."
In the paper was a bright five
dollar gold piece.</p>

<p>Betty read aloud what was on
the paper. Then she held up the
five dollar gold piece. How the
children did shout and clap their
hands. "Hurrah for Betty's Uncle
Fred!" they cried. "Hurrah for the
living airplane! Hurrah! Hurrah!
Hurrah!" When the last shout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
had been given, Showman Bob
stepped out. "Ladies and gentlemen,"
he said in his deep showman's
voice, "we thank you for
coming to the Pet Show. We know
the blind man will thank you too
when he gets his new dog. The
show will now close with a grand
parade!"</p>

<p>Then Bob made a showman's
bow and went behind the schoolhouse.
Soon a drum began to beat&mdash;<i>tum,
tum, tum</i>. The parade
was coming! First marched Showman
Bob beating the drum.
Behind him was Betty carrying a
big American flag. On her shoulder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
was Arrow, the living airplane.
Next came brave old Hero pulling a
little cart. In the cart were Snowball,
Fluff, and Muff and what was
left of Daddy's hat. Dot marched
beside the cart. After them came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Dandy. Paul was walking by his
side and holding something on his
back. It was Polly's cage with the
black cover off.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 332px;">
<img src="images/i013.jpg" width="332" height="300" alt="A parade!" title="A parade!" />
</div>

<p>Pretty Poll was peeping from
behind the wires. She looked surprised
and a little bit frightened.
Suddenly she rolled on her back at
the bottom of the cage. The last
thing the children heard as the
parade passed out of sight was,
"Come quick! Come quick! Polly's
sick! Polly's sick!"</p>

<p>I wish the children who read this
book could hear about the blind
man and his new dog but that is
another story.</p>

<h2>THE FIVE LITTLE FRIENDS<br />
IN VACATION</h2>


<h3><br />I</h3>

<p>Soon after the Pet Show, school
closed for the summer vacation.
The children said good-bye to each
other and to Miss West.</p>

<p>For weeks everybody had been
busy making plans for the summer.</p>

<p>Paul went to the seashore and
you may be sure brave Hero was
taken along.</p>

<p>Bob and his family went to the
seashore too; and, what was best of
all, they took a cottage not far
from where Paul lived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Dandy was sent out to the
country.</p>

<p>Betty's mother said, "I want to
have my little girl spend a summer
on a farm&mdash;a real farm," so they
went to Mr. White's.</p>

<p>See if you can guess who went
with them!</p>

<p>No, it wasn't Arrow. The living
airplane was left with Uncle Fred
at Grandmother's. It wasn't Miss
West. She went away on a long
trip across the ocean. It was a very
nice little person whose name begins
with <i>D</i>, and it was another very
nice little person whose name
begins with <i>P</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Peggy's mother went too, but Poll
was sent to a bird shop. Little Dot's
mother stayed in the city with
Dot's father and the cat family
to keep them from getting lonely.</p>

<p>Dot promised to be a good girl
and to do just what the other
mothers told her.</p>

<p>It was a bright June afternoon
when the three little girls and the
two mothers got off the train at a
little country station. Mr. White
came to meet them. He and Billy,
the hired man, piled all the trunks
and bags in a wagon. Then Billy
climbed up on the high seat and
cracked his whip, saying, "Get-up!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Get-up!" The horses pulled, the
dust flew, and away the wagon
went. Then Mr. White packed the
mothers and the little girls into his
automobile and away they also
went to the farm.</p>

<p>The farm was the very nicest
place in the whole world. At least
that is what the three little girls
thought. Everything about it was
nice. The rooms were big and cool
and low. The wide side porch was
a lovely place to eat dinner. The
big low attic was splendid for rainy-day
play; but the very, very nicest
of all the nice things at the farm
was Mary White.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary was nine years and she had
lived on the farm all her life. She
knew all the good places to play.
She could call every animal on the
farm by name. She could make up
the most delightful games. What a
splendid playmate she was!</p>

<p>First she took the children to the
pasture to see the cows. There
were three of them, Bonny-Belle,
Bess, and Buttercup.</p>

<p>Beside Buttercup was the dearest
little calf with long thin legs and a
soft tan coat. It was Don, Buttercup's
first baby. He was just two
months old and very full of life and
mischief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that another cow over there?"
said Peggy, pointing to a field
beyond the pasture. "Oh, no," said
Mary, "That's Big Ben. He is a
very wild and cross bull, so he has
to have a home all by himself. No
one ever goes into his field except
Billy. Big Ben seems to hate
people. But what he hates most
is anything that is red."</p>

<p>The children peeped in at Big
Ben, with nice safe-afraid shivers
going down their backs. Then Mary
said, "Come let's go to the farmyard."</p>

<p>The farmyard was a very busy
place. "I never saw so many pets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in all my life," said Betty. But
Mary knew them all. She showed
them Mrs. Speckle with her family
of little baby chicks that looked like
fluffy, yellow balls bobbing around
her.</p>

<p>Next she pointed out Mrs. Black
Hen with her larger children. Some
of these chickens were losing their
feathers. How Mary did laugh
when Peggy cried, "See, those poor
little chickens are peeling off!"</p>

<p>"Now," said Mary, "I will show
you my trained chicken." First she
went into the house and came out
with two ripe, red cherries still on
the stem. Then she called softly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
"Come, come, Tom Thumb," and
as she finished calling she put the
stem of the cherries between her
lips.</p>

<p>Out from among the other
chickens came a beautiful little
white rooster. He looked almost
like a toy, he was so tiny. With a
glad little crow he flew straight up
to Mary's shoulder, where he began
to peck at the cherries. He ate very
daintily. Sometimes he would stop
eating and cuddle down on Mary's
shoulder. When the ripe red treat
was all eaten he gave another glad
crow and flew down.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p><div class="figleft" style="width: 287px;">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" width="287" height="400" alt="MARY WHITE AND TOM THUMB" title="MARY WHITE AND TOM THUMB" />
<span class="caption">MARY WHITE AND TOM THUMB</span>
</div>

<p>Betty and Dot and Peggy loved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to help feed the chickens. Every
morning after breakfast Mrs. White
would come out into the yard with
a big pan of corn-meal mush and
Mary would follow with a smaller
pan of bread crumbs. Then both
mother and little girl would call,
"Chick, chick, chick! Chick, chick,
chick! Chick, chick, chick!" as if
they were singing the same tune
over and over. At this, such a
hurry and scurry as there would be!</p>

<p>It seemed as if every fowl on the
farm heard the call and was
coming. There were big hens and
little hens, brown hens, black hens,
white hens, and speckled hens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
There were fluffy baby chicks and
long-legged middle-sized chickens.
There were proud roosters with
bright combs and gay, glossy
feathers. There were stately turkeys
with long necks and great fan-like
tails. There were ducks with
long fat bodies and big flat feet.</p>

<p>Hurry, scurry! Scurry, hurry!
"Cluck, cluck." "Peep-peep."
"Groo-groo." "Gobble-gobble."
"Quack, quack." Such noise and
excitement you never heard!</p>

<p>Such table manners you never
saw! All were talking at once.
Everyone was pecking and pushing
and grabbing!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>One morning at the farmyard
breakfast Mrs. White said, "Where
can Brown Betty be? I haven't seen
her for two or three weeks. I am
afraid she has gone off and hidden
her nest somewhere. I wish I knew
where, for turkey eggs are scarce
this year. If you four children will
find her nest I will pay you ten
cents for each egg in it."</p>

<p>The little girls were very much
excited.</p>

<p>"Just suppose," said Betty, "that
we find a nest with six eggs in it.
That will be sixty cents. What
shall we buy with so much money?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be fun to get Father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to take us to the store and let us
buy things for a picnic?" said Mary.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, let's have a picnic,"
cried Peggy and Betty.</p>

<p>"But first," said wise little Dot,
"we must find Brown Betty's nest."</p>

<p>That very day the children began
to hunt for the hidden eggs. They
climbed up into the barn loft and
looked in the hay. Here they found
Mrs. Nicker on her nest. When
they came near she ruffled up her
feathers and gave an angry cluck.
"Don't be afraid," laughed Betty;
"we are looking for something
worth much more than one little
hen's egg."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 295px;">
<img src="images/i016.jpg" width="295" height="300" alt="In the hay" title="In the hay" />
</div>

<p>Then hidden down in the hay
they came across a mouse's home
with four baby mice in it. They
looked very small and young and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
funny. Their tiny eyes were shut
tight. "You are cunning little
things but you won't buy us a
picnic," said Peggy.</p>

<p>In the eaves of the barn they
found a swallow's nest, but the baby
birds had flown away. Only some
pieces of eggshell were left.</p>

<p>All that day and part of the next
and the next and the next the children
hunted and hunted but no
Brown Betty and no turkey eggs
could they find.</p>

<p>One bright June morning Mary
said, "Let's go into the woods to
play."</p>

<p>"Oh, may we?" Betty and Peggy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
asked their mothers. And little
Dot said, "Oh, please may I?" and
looked from one mother to the
other.</p>

<p>"Yes, let them go," said Mrs.
White. "The woods are not far
away and there is nothing to harm
them there."</p>

<p>So the four little girls started out.</p>

<p>They went down a shady lane
and through a meadow. Then they
came to the woods and wandered
about for a while. At last they
stopped by the side of a little brook
that flowed merrily on its way.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, shoes and
stockings were taken off and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
children were wading in the cool,
rippling water. It was lots of fun,
but the water was very cold. Soon
they were glad to dry their feet in
the soft grass and put on their shoes
and stockings again.</p>

<p>"Let's make a tree playhouse,"
said Mary; "I'll show you how." So
they set to work with Mary as
leader. They found a hollow tree
with plenty of room in it. Next
they gathered all the soft, velvety
moss they could find. With this
they made a thick green carpet on
the floor. Then they made green
moss furniture too. They had a
bed, a couch, a table, and a chair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"We should have some one to
live in our green, mossy house,"
said Peggy. "Let's go to the
meadow and gather some daisies
and make little flower people out
of them."</p>

<p>So off the children went. In a
little while, back they came with
their hands full of flowers.</p>

<p>Peggy was the first one to reach
the tree house. She looked in and
then began to laugh and call to the
others to come quickly.</p>

<p>"We needn't make any flower
people for our house," she said.
"It's already rented." And sure
enough, there on the green moss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
couch was a fat brown toad. He
was winking and blinking and looking
much pleased with his new home.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 295px;">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" width="295" height="300" alt="Mr. Toad" title="Mr. Toad" />
</div>

<p>The children sat down to rest and
watch Mr. Toad. All of a sudden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
they heard a queer sound. "Cheep-cheep!
Cheep-cheep! Cheep-cheep-cheep!"
It seemed to come from
the bushes.</p>

<p>"It must be some little birds,"
said Betty.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is a mother quail and
her babies," said Mary.</p>

<p>Very carefully the four little girls
peeped through the leaves and
bushes.</p>

<p>Can you guess what they saw?</p>

<p>There, walking about in an open
place in the woods, was Brown
Betty, and running beside her and
talking to her in turkey talk were
eight baby turkeys.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>How excited the children were!
They all wanted to run to the farmhouse
with the good news. But at
last they drew lots to see who
should go.</p>

<p>"I will hold four daisies," said
Peggy, "and each of you may take
one. The girl who gets the daisy
with the longest stem may run
ahead. If you leave the longest
one in my hand, I will go."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mary, "and the other
children may drive Brown Betty
and her brood back to the farmyard."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 289px;">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" width="289" height="400" alt="AWAY SHE RAN" title="AWAY SHE RAN" />
<span class="caption">AWAY SHE RAN</span>
</div>

<p>So they drew the daisies and little
Dot had the one with the longest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
stem. Away she ran as fast as her
short legs could carry her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. White," she cried, as
she reached the farmhouse, "we
found Brown Betty in the woods,
but her eggs have all turned
into little turkeys."</p>

<p>While Mrs. White was laughing
over Dot's way of telling the news,
the other children came up with
Brown Betty and her brood.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear," said Mrs. White,
"as the eggs have turned into turkeys
I will let the money I promised
turn into a picnic. Let me see,
to-day is Tuesday. Will you be
ready to go on Thursday?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed we will!" cried the children.
"Thank you so much."</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning Mary
woke up very, very early.</p>

<p>Then Mary woke Betty and
Peggy and little Dot.</p>

<p>They all dressed as quickly as
they could and hurried out of doors.
The sun was just rising and the sky
was a beautiful red and gold. The
dew sparkled on the grass, and in
the tree tops the birds were just
beginning to chirp and call.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, my pretty
maids?" laughed Mr. White.</p>

<p>"We're 'going a-milking, sir, she
said,'" Mary replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Then each little girl took a tin
cup and followed Mr. White and
Billy to the pasture where Bonny-Belle
and Bess stood waiting. Billy
let down the bars and the cows
came into the barnyard. Mr.
White milked Bonny-Belle and
Billy milked Bess.</p>

<p>The little girls stood near and
watched.</p>

<p>How Mr. White and Billy
laughed when little Dot said, "Oh,
is that the way you get milk on a
farm? We get ours out of bottles."</p>

<p>Before milking time was over
each little girl held her cup and had
it milked full of fresh, new milk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>At first the children thought
they would carry the cups home
and drink the milk for breakfast.
But they were so hungry they
couldn't wait, so they drank it
standing in the barnyard, with
Bonny-Belle and Bess looking at
them with soft, kind eyes.</p>

<p>That afternoon Mary had some
work to do and Betty and Peggy
went for a walk with their mothers.</p>

<span class="caption">DOT AND DON</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>Little Dot was tired from her
early morning visit to the barnyard.
So she took a book of fairy
stories and went out into the
near-by field. She settled herself
cozily under a big maple tree and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
began to read. After a little while
the book slid from her hands. Her
head nodded and nodded and then
rested on the grass. Her eyes
winked and winked and then closed.</p>

<p>She must have slept almost an
hour when she woke with a start.
Something very soft and moist was
moving over her nose and cheeks.
It felt almost as if her face were
being washed with a sticky cloth.</p>

<p>Dot opened her sleepy blue eyes
and looked right into the big brown
eyes of Don, Buttercup's baby calf.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" cried the little girl.</p>

<p>"Ma-a-a," replied Don as he
frisked away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are a dear little thing," Dot
called after him, "but I wish you
wouldn't kiss me with your tongue
all over my face."</p>

<p>The morning of the picnic was
bright and clear. There was great
excitement in the kitchen and pantry.
Mrs. White and Molly, the
maid, were fixing the lunch, but the
four little girls couldn't help popping
in every few minutes to take
a peep. The two other mothers
peeped too. What they saw made
them wish that they were to be
invited to the picnic. But this
time only the four little girls who
had found Brown Betty were to go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the lunch was packed in
four baskets and off the children
went.</p>

<p>On their way they found some
wild strawberries. They stopped
to pick them, and Mary showed the
others how to make leaf baskets to
hold berries. They gathered broad,
flat leaves and fastened them
together with little twigs.</p>

<p>Then they went on until at last
they came to the loveliest spot you
ever saw. It was an open space
with trees all around it. Near-by
was a little bubbling spring.</p>

<p>The children set their baskets in
the shade and began to romp and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
play. They played "Hide-and-Go-Seek"
and a new game which they
called "Echo." Can you guess how
to play this game?</p>

<p>At last they grew tired and hungry
and began to unpack their baskets
and to put their lunch on a
mossy spot near the brook. Such a
feast you never saw! Everything a
child likes best came out of those
baskets. How the four children did
eat and eat and eat! And when
they had eaten and eaten and eaten
until they could eat no more, there
were still some good things left.</p>

<p>"Let's rest a while," said Mary,
"and perhaps we'll be hungry again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Shall I tell you a fairy story?"</p>

<p>"Oh, please do," said Betty; and
Peggy and Dot echoed together,
"Please do."</p>

<p>So Mary told them of a fairy ball
where all the little fairies came out
of their flower cups and danced by
the light of the moon.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't this spot be a lovely
place for a fairy ball?" said Peggy,
when Mary had finished the story.
"I wonder if there are any fairies in
this wood."</p>

<p>"I know how we can find out,"
cried Betty. "We can give the
fairies a party."</p>

<p>"But they only come out at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
night," said Dot, "so we couldn't
see them."</p>

<p>"But," replied Betty, "we can
make a feast for them; and, if the
next morning we find the feast is
gone, we shall know the fairies
really came."</p>

<p>"Oh, let's do it," cried Dot and
Peggy. And Mary said, "If we
want the fairies to come we must
make a magic ring of flowers."
"That will be lots of fun," cried the
children.</p>

<p>So for the rest of the afternoon
they were very busy indeed.</p>

<p>They went to the meadow and
gathered clover blossoms. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
they sat down on the moss and
made a magic ring.</p>

<p>When the magic ring was placed
around a lovely mossy spot they
began to set the table for the feast.</p>

<p>"We'll give them cake and some
ripe strawberries," said Betty.</p>

<p>"But fairies eat dewdrops served
on rose leaves," said Peggy.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i020.jpg" width="300" height="292" alt="The magic ring" title="The magic ring" />
</div>

<p>"When they come to a party
given by little girls, they eat just
what little girls give them. You'll
see," said Betty. So the moss table
was set with leaf plates, and on
each plate were a ripe, red strawberry
and a fairy-size piece of cake.
When everything was ready the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
children danced around the magic
ring three times to make it more
magic. Then they packed their
baskets and went home, feeling very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
tired but very happy and much
pleased with the picnic.</p>

<p>That night Betty could not go to
sleep for a long, long time. She lay
in bed and watched the moonbeams.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she thought,
"whether the fairies will come. I
wonder whether the man in the
moon is looking down at them now.
I wonder"&mdash;and then she went to
sleep and dreamed that she was
dancing around and around the
magic ring with the man in the
moon. All around them fairies
were sliding up and down from the
tree tops to the mossy ground, on
silver moonbeams.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day the children went
to the woods to see whether the
fairies had been there. Betty
reached the spot first and cried out
joyfully, "They came! They came!"
And sure enough, the leaf plates
were empty. Every strawberry,
every crumb of cake, was gone.</p>

<p>"The fairies really came," said the
other little girls as they stood
around the magic ring.</p>

<p>"Tweet-tweet-tweet," sang a bird
in a tree top; "tweet-tweet-tweet."</p>

<p>He cocked his little head and
looked very wise and knowing. But
"Tweet-tweet-tweet; tweet-tweet-tweet"
was all he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the things Peggy and
Betty and Dot liked best to do was
to watch Mrs. White skim the rich
cream from the great pans of milk
in the dairy. The dairy was down
by the brook and the pans of milk
were on shelves near the water, so
that they were kept fresh and cool.</p>

<p>One very warm day Mary said,
"Let's play dairy."</p>

<p>"All right," said Betty.</p>

<p>"All right," echoed Peggy and
Dot. "You show us how."</p>

<p>So Mary brought two big pans
and two pieces of soap from the
kitchen. She filled the pans with
water and put a piece of soap in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
each pan. Then she told the other
children to watch the cream rise.
She began to shake the soap about
in the water, and the suds rose
higher and higher.</p>

<p>"It's rather <i>white</i> cream," she
said, "but we can play it comes
from a cow named Snowball."</p>

<p>"It's splendid cream," cried the
three little girls. "May we help
make it?"</p>

<p>"I wonder whether Molly will let
us use her cream skimmers," said
Mary.</p>

<p>Molly heard her name and came
to the kitchen door to see what
mischief those blessed children were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
up to now. She saw the pans on a
seat built round a big maple tree
and the four little girls bobbing
about, very busy indeed.</p>

<p>"Molly, will you please let us
have the skimmers?" Peggy cried.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Molly, "as it's
clean dirt you're making I suppose
I must."</p>

<p>So Mary and Betty made the
cream rise, and Dot and Peggy
skimmed it and poured it into
bottles and old cans to "sell."</p>

<p>While they were in the midst of
the fun, Red Chief, the proudest
rooster in the farmyard, came
strutting along.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" width="341" height="300" alt="Red Chief" title="Red Chief" />
</div>

<p>He put his head on one side and
looked at the pans. "Too-ok,
too-ok, too-ok. Is it feeding time?"
he said. "Too-ok, too-ok, too-ok.
I must see; I must see; I must see."
With that he flapped his great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
red wings and flew up on the side
of the pan.</p>

<p>Now Red Chief was a heavy
rooster and the pan was not
very firm. Down tumbled the pan
and Red Chief together. The
make-believe cream and milk went
all over him. Such a wet, cross,
disgusted rooster you never saw!
"Too-ok, too-ok, too-ok," he
croaked, as he shook the soapsuds
from his feathers. Then away he
marched, scolding to himself about
little girls who played silly games.</p>

<p>One afternoon the children were
out in the orchard playing "lady."
Mary and Betty were the mothers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in the game. Peggy and Dot were
the children.</p>

<p>Betty had on a long skirt and a
fine grown-lady's hat. Mary had a
scarf trailing on the ground instead
of a long skirt, and she carried her
mother's very best umbrella. It
was a bright red one that could be
used for sun as well as rain. It
made Mary feel very grown-up
indeed. The two "play" families
made their homes under the trees.
They paid visits back and forth.
They gave tea parties. The children
had measles and mumps and
were put to bed on the grass with
leaf plasters over their faces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary was Mrs. Ray and Dot was
her little daughter, Lily.</p>

<p>At last Mrs. Ray sent Lily to the
meadow to buy some flowers. Dot
danced gaily away. Just as she was
gathering the flowers, a bright,
blue butterfly lighted near her and
then flew a little farther on. He
seemed to be inviting her to race
with him. So off Dot started.</p>

<p>Her fat little legs seemed to
twinkle over the grass, but the
butterfly went faster still. Away he
flew across the pasture, away over
the fence into the next lot. Dot
paused only a minute, then she
slipped under the wire of the fence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and followed. On and on she went.
She did not notice where she was
going. But the butterfly fluttered
far ahead and was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>Then Dot stopped and looked
around. She was in a strange field.
No living thing was about. Yes,
something was moving over in the
far corner. It turned around and
seemed to sniff the air. Poor little
Dot stood almost frozen with fright.
It was Big Ben.</p>

<p>Then Dot did the worst thing
she could have done. She gave a
loud cry and began to run.</p>

<p>Big Ben shook himself and sniffed
the air again. Then he began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
come toward her in great bounds,
with his head down.</p>

<p>Back in the orchard the make-believe
Mrs. Ray had begun to
wonder why her little girl was staying
so long. At last with her
scarf across her shoulders and her
umbrella over her head she went
out to find her daughter.</p>

<p>Mary reached the meadow just as
Dot screamed.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood still and
looked around. The meadow was
empty. Then she knew that little
Dot was in the field with Big Ben.</p>

<p>Swift as the wind Mary ran on,
closing the umbrella as she went.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the fence she crept and
ran toward Dot.</p>

<p>Poor little Dot was running and
stumbling and crying. Big Ben
was bounding nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," Mary called,
as she came up to the little girl.</p>

<p>Then Mary did a strange thing.
She opened the red umbrella and
whirled it around and around.
Then she threw it toward Big Ben
as far as it would go. It went
rolling over the grass, with Big
Ben bounding wildly after it.</p>

<p>The red umbrella made him so
angry that he forgot all about the
little girls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 286px;">
<img src="images/i022.jpg" width="286" height="400" alt="BIG BEN BOUNDED AFTER THE UMBRELLA" title="BIG BEN BOUNDED AFTER THE UMBRELLA" />
<span class="caption">BIG BEN BOUNDED AFTER THE UMBRELLA</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary and Dot crept under the
fence to safety.</p>

<p>"O Mother," sobbed Mary, when
the children reached home and told
the story, "O Mother, your lovely
red umbrella is all ruined!"</p>

<p>"But my little girl is safe," said
Mrs. White, "and she has saved the
life of her little friend." Mrs.
White put her arm around Mary
and held her tightly, and drew little
Dot to her, too, just as Dot's own
mother would have done.</p>

<p>I wish you could hear all the
things Betty, Peggy, and little Dot
did on the farm. It would take a
great, big book to hold the story;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and this is a little book for little
folks.</p>

<p>At last the summer vacation was
over. The three little girls and the
two mothers had to leave their
friends on the farm and go back to
the city.</p>

<p>The little girls said good-bye to
every living thing on the place&mdash;to
the little pet rooster, to Red Chief,
to the Speckle family, and to Mrs.
Black Hen and her children who
were now almost grown and had
whole suits of clothes on. They
said good-bye to Brown Betty and
her children. They went to the
pasture and said good-bye to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Bonny-Belle, Bess, and Buttercup,
and to frisky little Don. They
even stood at the fence and waved
good-bye to bad Big Ben.</p>

<p>Then the two mothers and the
three little girls said good-bye to
Mrs. White and Billy and Molly
and last of all to dear little Mary,
who promised to come and visit
them at Christmas time.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye!"
they called as Mr. White tucked
them into the automobile and drove
away. "We've had a happy,
happy summer!"</p>

<p>When they reached the city, little
Dot's father was at the station to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
meet them. How glad he was to
see his little girl again! And how
happy Dot was to put her arms
around dear Daddy's neck!</p>

<p>"How is Mother?" she said, "and
how are Snowball and Fluff and
Muff?"</p>

<p>"Everyone is well," said Daddy,
"and I have a grand surprise for
you."</p>

<p>"What is it, Daddy?" cried little
Dot.</p>

<p>Betty and Peggy came near to
listen too.</p>

<p>"That's telling," laughed Daddy.
"I'd rather show you when we get
home."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"May Betty and Peggy go with
us?" he asked the two mothers. I
think the two mothers must have
known the secret. They smiled
and said, "Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>So off the three little girls went
with Dot's father.</p>

<p>When they reached Dot's house
no one was at the door to meet
them.</p>

<p>This seemed strange.</p>

<p>At the head of the stairs a
strange lady with a cap and apron
on was standing and smiling at
them. She led them into the front
room, still smiling but saying nothing.
This made it very exciting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 361px;">
<img src="images/i023.jpg" width="361" height="300" alt="The surprise" title="The surprise" />
</div>

<p>There in an easy chair was Dot's
mother. She was holding something
in her arms. At her feet
were Snowball and the kittens
sound asleep in their basket.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, Mother, Mother!" cried little
Dot running to her.</p>

<p>"My own little girl!" said
Mother. "See, here is a darling
new pet for you and Daddy and
me."</p>

<p>She held out the bundle in her
arms, and it was a dear little baby
brother.</p>

<p>"The very best pet in all the
world!" said little Dot.</p>

<p>And Betty and Peggy thought so
too.</p>


<h3><br />II</h3>

<p>But what have Paul and Bob
been doing all this time? We will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
have to go back to the beginning of
vacation and see.</p>

<p>The place where they spent the
summer was called Fairport. At
Fairport there was a wide, smooth,
sandy beach. Here the boys went
in bathing, built sand forts, and
gathered shells.</p>

<p>On one part of the shore the
beach was very narrow. Great
rocks rose like a fort above it.
Paul and Bob liked to play on the
rocks. Sometimes they played that
they were Indians and sometimes
that they were cave men.</p>

<p>They found a place under the
rocks for their cave. When they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
pretended that they were pirates,
they hid their treasures in the cave.
Their treasures were things they
found on the beach. There were
shells and boxes, and bottles and
queer bits of china and glass. Hero
was a fierce monster guarding the
treasure.</p>

<p>Sometimes the boys put Hero in
the cave and pretended he was a
lion. Then they stole into his den
and captured him and sold him to a
circus man. The circus man was
Roy, a little boy who liked to play
with them.</p>

<p>One day Bob and Paul and Roy
saw some big boys standing on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
wharf. They were catching crabs.
First they baited their lines and
then threw them into the water.
When the crabs "bit" they drew
them in. It looked very exciting.
The three little boys wanted to try.</p>

<p>So they found strings and the big
boys gave them some bait. Bob
and Roy had good luck. But Paul
was so excited he couldn't pull his
line in quickly enough to catch a
crab. At last he thought, "If I
wade into the water I'll be near the
crabs. Then it won't be so hard to
pull them in."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 284px;">
<img src="images/i024.jpg" width="284" height="400" alt="PAUL AND THE CRAB" title="PAUL AND THE CRAB" />
<span class="caption">PAUL AND THE CRAB</span>
</div>

<p>So down he climbed and into the
water he waded. Soon Bob and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Roy heard him call, "Oh, Oh, Oh,
come quick!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" called Bob. "Have
you caught a big crab?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Paul. He was
half laughing and half crying, and
all the time he was shaking his
foot as hard as he could. "Oh,
no, I haven't caught a crab. A&mdash;crab&mdash;has&mdash;caught
me!" And sure
enough, a big fat crab had nipped
Paul's toe and was holding it fast.</p>

<p>Bob climbed down and pulled it
off. Paul went home and tied
up his sore toe. Then he came
back and sat on the wharf and
watched the others. Somehow, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
didn't feel like catching crabs. So
he pretended he was a sailor who
had been bitten by a big shark.</p>

<p>One day Bob and Paul found a
very nice bottle on the beach. It
had a tight cork so that the water
could not soak in. At first they
thought they would hide it in their
treasure cave. But that didn't
seem exciting enough. So they
thought and thought what to do
with it. At last Bob said, "I know!
Let's write our names and where
we live on a piece of paper and put
it in the bottle. Then let's throw
the bottle out to sea." So he
wrote:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i025.png" width="300" height="251" alt="The paper" title="The paper" />
</div>

<p>They put the paper in the bottle
and corked the bottle tightly.
Then they threw it out into the
ocean. At first the bottle bobbed
up and down in the water. But
soon a big wave caught it and
carried it out of sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose," said Paul, "the bottle
goes way out to sea and a big
whale swallows it. And suppose it
makes the big whale so sick that he
swims near to the shore. Then
some fishermen will catch him and
kill him. When they cut him open
they will find the bottle, and when
they read our names they will know
we are the boys who helped them
get the great big whale."</p>

<p>"Or," said Bob, "suppose the
bottle goes out to sea and a man in
a seaplane sees it and opens it. And
suppose he comes flying to Fairport
and when he lands here he asks
where we are. Then when he finds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
us he takes us for a long, long ride
in his seaplane."</p>

<p>It was great fun supposing. The
next morning Bob and Paul went to
the beach all ready to have some
more supposes.</p>

<p>But what was that small thing
lying on the sand? It looked very
much like a bottle. Yes, it was. It
was <i>the</i> bottle!</p>

<p>Bob picked it up and looked
rather disappointed. Paul looked
disappointed too. "Our supposes
are no good now," he said. "Oh
yes," cried Bob, "I know a fine
suppose. It's so good it's almost
true. Let's pretend a big wave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
was the parcel postman." When
he saw the bottle away out in the
ocean with our names in it, he
brought it straight to us. "Why,
of course," said Paul. "The parcel
postman had to bring the bottle
to us. He couldn't take it to
the whale or to the man with the
seaplane. It wasn't addressed to
them."</p>

<p>One day Bob's father took Paul
and Bob out fishing. They carried
their bait in a tin can and they
took a larger can to hold their fish.
They stood on a high rock and
threw their lines out into the deep
water. The fish bit very well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Mr. Johnson caught five or six.
But the boys were so excited they
could not wait. They drew up
their lines too soon. Once Paul felt
a pull and waited. When he felt
another pull he drew in his line. On
it was a very tiny fish. "It's too
small to keep," said Mr. Johnson.
So he took it carefully off the hook
and threw it back into the water.</p>

<p>In a little while Bob felt a pull on
his line. He held it very still and
waited. Soon there was another
pull&mdash;a very strong one. Then
there came a jerk that almost
threw him down. "Now draw in
your line," said Mr. Johnson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
"Steady, steady!" Bob pulled. His
line almost broke. He pulled and
tugged and pulled again. Then up
came the line and on it was a fish&mdash;a
big, beautiful fish flapping and
twisting. "Good, good," cried Mr.
Johnson. "That's a prize catch."</p>

<p>How proud Bob felt as he landed
his fish. He wouldn't let his father
help take it off the hook. He did it
all himself. For a moment he stood
with the beautiful prize fish in his
hand. Some people were fishing
near-by and he wanted them to see.
He wanted them to know of his
prize catch. He felt very proud.
"Look," said one of them; "what a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
great big fish!" Bob heard and
felt prouder than ever. He threw
his fish into the can as if he were
saying, "Oh, that's nothing, I
<i>always</i> catch the biggest fish."
Then he began to bait his hook
again.</p>

<p>Just then Paul cried out, "Oh,
Oh, Oh!" quickly. Bob turned just
in time to see his prize fish flop out
of the can and back into the sea.</p>

<p>"Oh, Oh, Oh!" He was no longer
a proud fisherman. He was just a
very sad little boy.</p>

<p>On another day Bob and Paul
stopped in front of a little cottage.
A man was in the yard mending a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
big fish net and they liked to watch
him. The man was a strong young
fisherman.</p>

<p>At the door of the cottage sat
an old, old man with white hair.
A cane was by his side. He spoke
to Bob and Paul and let them come
in and sit on the steps near him.
He was the fisherman's father. He
was called Captain John. He had
once been a fisherman himself.
Now he was too old to work, but he
knew many stories of the sea. Bob
and Paul never grew tired of hearing
them. Every day they came to
the cottage. Captain John was
always there sitting in the doorway,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
with his cane by his side. He was
always ready to tell them an exciting
true story of the sea.</p>

<p>One day a big gray cat was
curled up at Captain John's feet.
"Is pussy your pet, Captain John?"
asked Bob. "No, little lad," said
the old man. "She belongs to my
daughter. My pet is almost as old
as I am. She's a brave old friend.
We have stuck by each other for
over fifty years. We've seen hard
times and good times together. And
now we are growing old side by side."</p>

<p>"Will you show her to us, please,
Captain John?" said the two little
boys.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes," replied the old man;
"come with me." He took his cane
and walking very, very slowly, he
took the boys around the cottage
to a tiny garden. There was one
spot in the garden that was bright
with flowers.</p>

<p>Captain John led them there.
"Here she is," he said. "Here's my
old friend, the <i>Sea Gull</i>, dressed up
in her Sunday clothes."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>The boys looked and saw that
the <i>Sea Gull</i> was a boat. She was
Captain John's pet&mdash;almost as old
as he was. She was his brave old
friend who had stuck by him for
over fifty years. Now she was too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
old for the sea so she had a home
in the tiny garden. The flowers
that had been planted in her were
her "Sunday clothes."</p>

<span class="caption">CAPTAIN JOHN AND THE SEA GULL</span>
</div>

<p>"She seems alive to me," said
Captain John. "I am glad we can
grow old side by side."</p>

<p>I wish you could hear of all the
good times Bob and Paul had at
Fairport. Every day was packed
with fun and both little boys grew
taller and very brown.</p>

<p>At last vacation time was nearly
over. Bob left Fairport first. He
and his family went home in his
father's automobile. They camped
out every night. The camping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
tents and the pots and pans were
strapped on the back of the automobile.
They rode all day. They
went over hills, through valleys,
and into cities.</p>

<p>One day they passed a flower
farm. "Oh, Mother," begged Bob,
"May I stop and buy some
flowers?" "Why, Bob," said his
mother, "What do you want with
flowers? We haven't any room for
them in the automobile."</p>

<p>"I don't want them to take
home," said Bob, "I want to send
them by the postman to Captain
John. They are for the <i>Sea Gull</i>."</p>

<p>So the automobile stopped and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Bob spent his birthday money at
the flower farm. The next day the
parcel post brought Captain John a
box of spring bulbs and fall plants.
With them was a card in Bob's
very best writing:</p>

</div>

<p>Paul stayed in Fairport a week
after Bob had left.</p>

<p>He was not lonely, for his daddy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
had come. Paul and his daddy
were great friends. They went
around together like two chums.</p>

<p>The day before Daddy's week
was up they went out for a long
sail. Mrs. Ray was afraid to go,
but Paul was not. He felt very big
and brave. With Daddy to sail the
boat everything would be all right.
The sun shone, the wind blew, and
away they started. The boat
seemed to skim along as lightly as
a sea gull.</p>

<p>At last they landed on a little
island. Paul helped his daddy
gather sticks and build a fire.
Mr. Ray put four ears of corn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
under the wood. Paul thought
they would burn up, but they
didn't. The husks covered them.
Next Mr. Ray put a pan on the
fire and fried some bacon and
some potatoes. Paul unpacked a
basket of sandwiches, and by that
time everything was ready. They
had no plates and no napkins.
They ate with their fingers, in just
the way little boys sometimes wish
to do and mustn't, when they are
at the table.</p>

<p>Daddy told stories of camping
and hunting as they sat by the fire.</p>

<p>Time passed very quickly. It was
four o'clock before they knew it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i028.jpg" width="350" height="218" alt="Boat" title="Boat" />
</div>

<p>"All aboard," cried Mr. Ray, and
in a very few minutes the lunch
things were packed up and they
were in the boat. At first the sails
filled and the boat moved swiftly
on. But suddenly the sky grew
dark. Great claps of thunder were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
heard. Lightning played all around
the boat. The wind blew fiercely.
The waves dashed so high that
the boat was almost upset. Paul
felt very small and almost afraid,
but not quite. His big, brave
daddy was there. "Sit still, hold
tight," Daddy called. His voice
sounded far away, the storm was
making such a noise.</p>

<p>It seemed hours and hours that
Paul sat still and held tight. He
grew cold and stiff and wet. The
sky became blacker and blacker.
The wind howled louder and louder.
Sometimes Daddy shouted, hoping
that some one in a bigger boat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
would hear and come to help him.
But no help came.</p>

<p>All at once a clear, bright light
shone over the water. "The lighthouse!"
cried Mr. Ray, "The
lighthouse! We are saved."</p>

<p>He turned the boat and steered
toward the light. It shone into the
darkness like a kind eye.</p>

<p>Fighting the wind and storm was
hard work, but at last the boat
reached the island on which the
lighthouse stood. As the boat
came to the shore Mr. Ray called
and called. At last the door of the
lighthouse opened and the keeper
came out. He helped pull the boat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to shore. Then he lifted Paul out
and carried him into the lighthouse
and Mr. Ray followed.</p>

<p>At first Paul was too wet and
cold and too much frightened to
care about anything. But when he
had been warmed and his clothes
dried he began to look around. He
was in a cheerful room with the
lighthouse keeper and his wife. His
dear daddy was there, too. And
there was another person in the
room. This was a little boy with a
very pale face. He sat in a wheeled
chair. His poor back was so weak
he could not walk. But his face
was bright and smiling. He held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
out his hand to Paul. "I'm Dick,"
he said, "I came to the lighthouse
in a storm too, and I've been here
ever since."</p>

<p>"Oh, please tell me about it,"
said Paul.</p>

<p>"It was eight years ago," began
Dick, "when Father Moore found
me in a boat. There had been a
shipwreck and I must have been in
it. I don't remember anything
about it. I was only two years old
and my back had been hurt. But
Father Moore saved me and he and
Mother Moore took me to be their
little boy."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's our little boy," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the lighthouse keeper, who was
"Father Moore." "We live here
together and keep the light."</p>

<p>"Don't you get lonely?" Paul
asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Dick, "I have a
great many things to play with.
See!" And he pointed to a big
table near his chair. On it were
many small toys. There was a
farm with fences, houses, horses,
cows, and chickens. There were
people too&mdash;a man, a woman, and
two children. Everything was
made of clay. There was a tall
clay lighthouse and around it were
clay ships and boats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 288px;">

<span class="caption">DICK AND HIS CLAY TOYS</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"What splendid toys," said Paul,
"Did Santa Claus bring them?"</p>

<p>"I made them myself," said Dick
proudly. "My back and legs aren't
much good but my fingers do whatever
I want them to. Whenever I
am lonely I think of something to
make and then my fingers make it.
I think," he went on laughing, "I'll
make you and your father after
you have gone."</p>

<p>Paul hated to leave the lighthouse
and brave little Dick. But
he and Daddy had to go as soon as
the storm was over. They knew
Mrs. Ray would be greatly worried
about them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll write to you," said Paul to
Dick, "and I'll send you some of
my books with pictures in them.
Then you can make more things."</p>

<p>How glad Paul's mother was
when her little boy and his daddy
reached home. That night she
came in to tuck him snugly in bed.</p>

<p>"Is my little boy sorry this is his
last night at Fairport?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, Mother," said Paul. "I
hate to leave Captain John, and the
cave, and the beach, and the ocean;
but I want to get home. I want to
see Bob and Betty and Peggy and
Dot. I want them to help me do
something for Dick."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you want to do, dear?"
asked Mrs. Ray.</p>

<p>"I want to send him something
to keep his fingers busy, perhaps
a tool chest and some wood," said
Paul. "And, O Mother, do you
think we could do something to
make his back strong?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can," answered
Mrs. Ray. "We must see what we
can do to help him."</p>

<p>You may be sure that some
happy days came to Dick after the
five little friends had put their
heads together.</p>
